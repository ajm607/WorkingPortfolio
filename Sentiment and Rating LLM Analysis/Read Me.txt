## Starbucks Review Sentiment Analysis

This project explores customer sentiment and star ratings from Starbucks reviews using 
natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer 
feedback and assess how textual sentiment aligns with numerical ratings.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization 
of review text
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Applied VADER to extract sentiment polarity and subjectivity
- **Rating Alignment**: Compared sentiment scores with actual star ratings to identify 
mismatches
- **Visualization**: Plotted sentiment distributions, rating histograms, and confusion 
matrix
- **Insights**: Highlighted common themes in positive vs negative reviews and flagged 
inconsistencies

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control

### Files
- `reviews_data.csv`: Raw review data
- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook
- `figures/`: Contains visualizations and plots

### Outcome
This analysis helps Starbucks and similar brands understand how customer language 
reflects satisfaction, and where rating systems may fail to capture nuanced feedback.
